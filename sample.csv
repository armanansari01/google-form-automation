Arman,The Economic Times,10-12-2012,"Vizag, a treat for bird watchers","VISAKHAPATNAM: If you happen to see someone early in the morning armed with a notebook, camera and a binocular slung around their neck, sneaking around the forested tracts of hilly Vizag, be assured that he or she is a bird watcher hoping to spot rare and exotic species of the winged creatures. Like Sanjay Singh, who teams up with friends for early morning drives to places in and around Vizag like Vuda Park, surroundings of the Naval base, vicinity of the zoo, Sagar Nagar and even the marshy areas near the airport just for the pleasure of sighting birds.“There’s a joy in discovering new species of birds and listening to their chirping. It is exciting to spot an almost extinct species. For instance, sparrows are spotted at Vuda Park and three varieties of Kingfishers are found near Sagar Nagar Nalla,” says Singh, rattling off the names of various bird species like any qualified ornithologist though he is an entrepreneur. The community of bird lovers and watchers is on the rise in the port city. And they hail from various walks of life - from businessmen to professionals like doctors, professors or professional photographers and students.Some go on bird watching jaunts over weekends while others venture out daily to catch a glimpse of the exotic birds in and around the city as well as the district. Many of them also hook up on social networking sites to flaunt their latest exploits and exchange notes on their findings. While the five-acre biodiversity park maintained by college students in the city boasts of around 70 species of birds including endemic and migratory ones, the other favourite haunts of bird lovers are around 50-100 kms from the city like Kondakarla near Anakapalli, Tellineelapuram in Srikakulam, Tellikubcha in Ichchapuram as well as the forested hills of Paderu, Ananthagiri and Araku. Though there is no organised bird-watchers' forum in Vizag yet, there are over three dozen bird watchers in the city and the number is growing, confirms Prof Baratha Lakshmi, city-based environmentalist and zoologist, who has written articles on hundreds of varieties of the winged beauties found in the Eastern Ghats.“It is not only those from the zoology department or those doing research in ornithology but students from various disciplines and professionals are also taking up it up as a hobby,” says Lakshmi, adding that in Vizag alone around 130 varieties of birds can be sighted.“Earlier, we were only a few but now our community is growing fast,” adds Lalith, a student and avid bird-watcher, who often goes bird-watching with fellow students. Bird watchers say birding is a hobby that helps expand one’s creative horizon and simultaneously fuels interest in a number of activities including wildlife photography, travelling, observing nature at close quarters and even penning down those observations.“It’s a pleasure watching colourful birds, photographing them and also recording their tweets. After all, admiring nature with all its flora and fauna, exploring new places, watching birds and butterflies and photography go hand in hand,” said professor of Zoology M Rama Murthy. Bird lovers say they have frequently come across the common hoopoe, plain back woodpeckers, golden oriole, cuckoos, parrots, Indian robin, spotted owl, sandpipers, black-headed and red-whiskered bulbul in and around the city, while in the marshy areas and near water bodies, they have spotted migratory ducks, cranes, herons and seagulls. And many of these bird watchers will go to any lengths to catch a glimpse of their feathered friends. “I keep travelling to rural and tribal areas surrounding Vizag in search of spoonbills and ducks. My students and I carry binoculars to get a clear view of their interesting nesting and feeding behaviour. In Kondakarla Lake, we travel in country boats or canoes to view the ducks and go to Telineelapuram to view pelicans and painted storks that come from Siberia during this season,” says Lakshmi.Singh, who has also spotted mountain birds like rufous woodpecker, coppersmith, and oriental white eye in and around the city, recently went on a trip to Tellikuncha in the Andhra-Odisha Border (AOB) to view the only migratory species that come here in winter – the Asian open billed stork. “We spotted around 3,000 of these this year as against more than 5,000 storks last year, due to a still warm winter,” Singh adds excitedly.","The bird-watching community in Visakhapatnam is growing, with enthusiasts exploring various locations like Vuda Park, Naval base surroundings, and Sagar Nagar for sightings. Bird watchers, including professionals and students, share their experiences on social networks. While the city's biodiversity park boasts 70 bird species, enthusiasts often visit locations 50-100 km away, such as Kondakarla and the forested hills of Paderu, Ananthagiri, and Araku. Although lacking an organized forum, the community, numbering over three dozen, continues to expand, appreciating the joy of discovering and observing diverse bird species.",Environment
